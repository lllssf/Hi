## 1 - The problem of very deep neural networks

Last week, you built your first convolutional neural network. In recent years, neural networks have become deeper, with state-of-the-art networks going from just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.

The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the lower layers) to very complex features (at the deeper layers). However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent unbearably slow. More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and "explode" to take very large values). 

During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the earlier layers descrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds
## 2 - Building a Residual Network

In ResNets, a "shortcut" or a "skip connection" allows the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers
### 2.1 - The identity block

The identity block is the standard block used in ResNets, and corresponds to the case where the input activation (say $a^{[l]}$) has the same dimension as the output activation (say $a^{[l+2]}$).
```
# GRADED FUNCTION: identity_block

def identity_block(X, f, filters, stage, block):
    """
    Implementation of the identity block as defined in Figure 3
    
    Arguments:
    X -- input tensor of shape (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev)
    f -- integer, specifying the shape of the middle CONV's window for the main path
    filters -- python list of integers, defining the number of filters in the CONV layers of the main path
    stage -- integer, used to name the layers, depending on their position in the network
    block -- string/character, used to name the layers, depending on their position in the network
    
    Returns:
    X -- output of the identity block, tensor of shape (n_H, n_W, n_C)
    """
    
    # defining name basis
    conv_name_base = 'res' + str(stage) + block + '_branch'
    bn_name_base = 'bn' + str(stage) + block + '_branch'
    
    # Retrieve Filters
    F1, F2, F3 = filters
    
    # Save the input value. You'll need this later to add back to the main path. 
    X_shortcut = X
    
    # First component of main path
    X = Conv2D(filters=F1, kernel_size=(1, 1), strides=(1,1), padding ='valid', name = conv_name_base + '2a', kernel_initializer = glorot_uniform(seed=0))(X)
    X = BatchNormalization(axis = 3, name = bn_name_base + '2a')(X)
    X = Activation('relu')(X)

    X = BatchNormalization(axis=3, name=bn_name_base+'2b')(X)
    X = Activation('relu')(X)

    # Third component of main path (≈2 lines)

    # Final step: Add shortcut value to main path, and pass it through a RELU activation (≈2 lines)
    X = Add()([X, X_shortcut])
    X = Activation('relu')(X)
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return X
```
## 2.2 - The convolutional block
You've implemented the ResNet identity block. Next, the ResNet "convolutional block" is the other type of block. You can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions don't match up.

The CONV2D layer in the shortcut path is used to **resize** the input $x$ to a different dimension, so that the dimensions match up in the final addition needed to add the shortcut value back to the main path. (This plays a similar role as the matrix $W_s$ discussed in lecture.) For example, to reduce the activation dimensions's height and width by a factor of 2, you can use a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2. The CONV2D layer on the shortcut path does not use any non-linear activation function. Its main role is to just apply a (learned) linear function that reduces the dimension of the input, so that the dimensions match up for the later addition step.
