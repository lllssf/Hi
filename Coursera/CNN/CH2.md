### 1.1 - Create placeholders

TensorFlow requires that you create placeholders for the input data that will be fed into the model when running the session.

**Exercise**: Implement the function below to create placeholders for the input image X and the output Y. You should not define the number of training examples for the moment. To do so, you could use "None" as the batch size, it will give you the flexibility to choose it later. Hence X should be of dimension **[None, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0]** and Y should be of dimension **[None, n_y]**.  [Hint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder).
```
# GRADED FUNCTION: create_placeholders

def create_placeholders(n_H0, n_W0, n_C0, n_y):
    """
    Creates the placeholders for the tensorflow session.
    
    Arguments:
    n_H0 -- scalar, height of an input image
    n_W0 -- scalar, width of an input image
    n_C0 -- scalar, number of channels of the input
    n_y -- scalar, number of classes
        
    Returns:
    X -- placeholder for the data input, of shape [None, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0] and dtype "float"
    Y -- placeholder for the input labels, of shape [None, n_y] and dtype "float"
    """

    ### START CODE HERE ### (â‰ˆ2 lines)
    X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,[None,64,64,3])
    Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,[None,6])
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return X, Y
```
### 1.2 - Initialize parameters

You will initialize weights/filters $W1$ and $W2$ using `tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 0)`. You don't need to worry about bias variables as you will soon see that TensorFlow functions take care of the bias. Note also that you will only initialize the weights/filters for the conv2d functions. TensorFlow initializes the layers for the fully connected part automatically. We will talk more about that later in this assignment.

**Exercise:** Implement initialize_parameters(). The dimensions for each group of filters are provided below. Reminder - to initialize a parameter $W$ of shape [1,2,3,4] in Tensorflow, use:
```python
W = tf.get_variable("W", [1,2,3,4], initializer = ...)
```
[More Info](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_variable).
```
# GRADED FUNCTION: initialize_parameters

def initialize_parameters():
    """
    Initializes weight parameters to build a neural network with tensorflow. The shapes are:
                        W1 : [4, 4, 3, 8]

    ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 2 lines of code)
    W1 = tf.get_variable('W1',shape=[4,4,3,8],initializer = tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 0))
    W2 = tf.get_variable('W2',shape=[2,2,8,16],initializer = tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 0))
    ### END CODE HERE ###

    parameters = {"W1": W1,
                  "W2": W2}
    
    return parameters
```
### 1.2 - Forward propagation

In TensorFlow, there are built-in functions that carry out the convolution steps for you.

- **tf.nn.conv2d(X,W1, strides = [1,s,s,1], padding = 'SAME'):** given an input $X$ and a group of filters $W1$, this function convolves $W1$'s filters on X. The third input ([1,f,f,1]) represents the strides for each dimension of the input (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev). You can read the full documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d)

- **tf.nn.max_pool(A, ksize = [1,f,f,1], strides = [1,s,s,1], padding = 'SAME'):** given an input A, this function uses a window of size (f, f) and strides of size (s, s) to carry out max pooling over each window. You can read the full documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/max_pool)

- **tf.nn.relu(Z1):** computes the elementwise ReLU of Z1 (which can be any shape). You can read the full documentation [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/relu)

- **tf.contrib.layers.flatten(P)**: given an input P, this function flattens each example into a 1D vector it while maintaining the batch-size. It returns a flattened tensor with shape [batch_size, k]. You can read the full documentation [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/flatten)

- **tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(F, num_outputs):** given a the flattened input F, it returns the output computed using a fully connected layer. You can read the full documentation [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/fully_connected)

In the last function above (`tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected`), the fully connected layer automatically initializes weights in the graph and keeps on training them as you train the model. Hence, you did not need to initialize those weights when initializing the parameters. 


**Exercise**: 

Implement the `forward_propagation` function below to build the following model: `CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED`. You should use the functions above. 

In detail, we will use the following parameters for all the steps:
     - Conv2D: stride 1, padding is "SAME"
     - ReLU
     - Max pool: Use an 8 by 8 filter size and an 8 by 8 stride, padding is "SAME"
     - Conv2D: stride 1, padding is "SAME"
     - ReLU
     - Max pool: Use a 4 by 4 filter size and a 4 by 4 stride, padding is "SAME"
     - Flatten the previous output.
     - FULLYCONNECTED (FC) layer: Apply a fully connected layer without an non-linear activation function. Do not call the softmax here. This will result in 6 neurons in the output layer, which then get passed later to a softmax. In TensorFlow, the softmax and cost function are lumped together into a single function, which you'll call in a different function when computing the cost.
