### 3.1 - Zero-Padding

Zero-padding adds zeros around the border of an image:

The main benefits of padding are the following:

- It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the "same" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer. 

- It helps us keep more of the information at the border of an image. Without padding, very few values at the next layer would be affected by pixels as the edges of an image.

**Exercise**: Implement the following function, which pads all the images of a batch of examples X with zeros. [Use np.pad](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html). Note if you want to pad the array "a" of shape $(5,5,5,5,5)$ with `pad = 1` for the 2nd dimension, `pad = 3` for the 4th dimension and `pad = 0` for the rest, you would do:
```python
a = np.pad(a, ((0,0), (1,1), (0,0), (3,3), (0,0)), 'constant', constant_values = (..,..))
```
```
# GRADED FUNCTION: zero_pad

def zero_pad(X, pad):
    """
    Pad with zeros all images of the dataset X. The padding is applied to the height and width of an image, 
    as illustrated in Figure 1.
    
    Argument:
    X -- python numpy array of shape (m, n_H, n_W, n_C) representing a batch of m images
    pad -- integer, amount of padding around each image on vertical and horizontal dimensions
    
    Returns:
    X_pad -- padded image of shape (m, n_H + 2*pad, n_W + 2*pad, n_C)

    X_pad = np.pad(X, ((0,0), (pad,pad), (pad,pad), (0,0)), 'constant', constant_values = (pad,pad))

    return X_pad
```
### 3.2 - Single step of convolution 

In this part, implement a single step of convolution, in which you apply the filter to a single position of the input. This will be used to build a convolutional unit, which: 

- Takes an input volume 
- Applies a filter at every position of the input
- Outputs another volume (usually of different size)

In a computer vision application, each value in the matrix on the left corresponds to a single pixel value, and we convolve a 3x3 filter with the image by multiplying its values element-wise with the original matrix, then summing them up and adding a bias. In this first step of the exercise, you will implement a single step of convolution, corresponding to applying a filter to just one of the positions to get a single real-valued output. 

Later in this notebook, you'll apply this function to multiple positions of the input to implement the full convolutional operation. 

**Exercise**: Implement conv_single_step(). [Hint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html).


```
# GRADED FUNCTION: conv_single_step

def conv_single_step(a_slice_prev, W, b):
    """
    Apply one filter defined by parameters W on a single slice (a_slice_prev) of the output activation 
    of the previous layer.
    
    Arguments:
    a_slice_prev -- slice of input data of shape (f, f, n_C_prev)
    W -- Weight parameters contained in a window - matrix of shape (f, f, n_C_prev)
    b -- Bias parameters contained in a window - matrix of shape (1, 1, 1)
    
    Returns:
    Z -- a scalar value, result of convolving the sliding window (W, b) on a slice x of the input data
    """

    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 2 lines of code)
    # Element-wise product between a_slice and W. Do not add the bias yet.
    s = np.multiply(a_slice_prev,W)
    # Sum over all entries of the volume s.
    Z = np.sum(s)
    # Add bias b to Z. Cast b to a float() so that Z results in a scalar value.
    Z += b
    ### END CODE HERE ###

    return Z
```
### 3.3 - Convolutional Neural Networks - Forward pass

In the forward pass, you will take many filters and convolve them on the input. Each 'convolution' gives you a 2D matrix output. You will then stack these outputs to get a 3D volume。

**Exercise**: Implement the function below to convolve the filters W on an input activation A_prev. This function takes as input A_prev, the activations output by the previous layer (for a batch of m inputs), F filters/weights denoted by W, and a bias vector denoted by b, where each filter has its own (single) bias. Finally you also have access to the hyperparameters dictionary which contains the stride and the padding. 

**Hint**: 
1. To select a 2x2 slice at the upper left corner of a matrix "a_prev" (shape (5,5,3)), you would do:
```python
a_slice_prev = a_prev[0:2,0:2,:]
```
This will be useful when you will define `a_slice_prev` below, using the `start/end` indexes you will define.
2. To define a_slice you will need to first define its corners `vert_start`, `vert_end`, `horiz_start` and `horiz_end`. This figure may be helpful for you to find how each of the corner can be defined using h, w, f and s in the code below.
